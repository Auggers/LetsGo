forloop that loops through array
outputs the current position - U44 = 44,0 - D45 = -1,0 - L44 = -1,-44
Loop through both
log every position that they hit and store those cordinates in a slice
compare every position hit with each slice and add the matching cordinates into another slice
At end of loop take new array and loop through to see which is closest to 0,0 by using the y + x = total

Use an interface to store both arrays and numbers?
